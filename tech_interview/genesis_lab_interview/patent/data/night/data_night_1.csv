Using this Fluid Property Regulator, the property profiles of a non-enclosed material, including property profiles related to material density, chemical characteristics and space-time position, are affected due to motion of the material relative to a body in the flow stream. The state of other matter with which the initial material then makes direct or indirect contact is also affected. For example, in the case of a liquid such as an ocean current, the temperature, salinity, nutrient content and other properties may be destratified (i.e. layers being combined) as the system lifts large quantities of deep water and combines this material with surface water in the downstream far-field region of the system. The resulting regulation of such ocean water property profiles may then also indirectly affect the properties of the atmosphere above the ocean so that the system can be said to affect planetary properties both oceanic and atmospheric. Rather than merely discharging a pumped material, such as cold water that might quickly re-submerge, the system regulates lasting property profiles.

154,US,US,P,1,DriveOn Pay(TM) as WiMAX-compatible Menu-Driven Dashtop Mobile Payment Platform,"DriveOn Pay™ is a location-based Privacy-friendly dashtop mobile payment platform (DMPP), based on mobile WiMAX IEEE 802-16e-2005. It is an all-in-one solution geared to integrate all other dashtop gadgets in view of the growing necessity of the real-time bridge syncing cyberworld and real world, which is central to mobile broadband technology. The VIN-based Menu-Driven Fail-safe 5-mile-range DMPP envisions a BS and a Touchscreen On-Vehicle CPE named VIMO™, powered by the vehicle battery. It works as an Unmanned Booth-free Toll-Collection Maximizer at any vehicle speed; Transportation Hub Security Enforcer for non-linear surveillance of passengers plus non-passengers, both indoors and outdoors; ‘JIT e-Commerce on the Go’ (JITeCGO) Creator; Ticket-free Biometrics-free Remote Check-In & Admission Optimizer for ballparks, expos, parking garages, and transportation hubs. After all, it is to provide an optimal solution to metropolitan traffic surges, wherever they may happen, utilizing the Disposable Ephemeral Digital ID (DEDID) and the vehicle-to-vehicle mobile P2P.","1. DriveOn Pay™ as a WiMAX-compatible Menu-driven Dashtop Mobile Payment Platform Rationales: 1) A paradigm shift: With Drive-On Pay™, User carries a VIMO™ unit as a virtual payment terminal, as opposed to the current practice of merchants carrying payment terminals at storefronts. In return, a proprietary menu is respectively offered wirelessly by merchants or stores. A payment terminal at a storefront limits financial transaction one at a time, whereas Drive-On Pay™ allows thousands at a time. 2) Metropolitan Area Network-enabled wireless paying platform configured for the combined use of the following: User-centric menu LCD touchscreen the programmed short keys a bandwidth-saving protocol and time-memory tradeoff (TMTO) advantages of minimizing Codec procedures. 3) Theoretical payment processing capacity: at a rate of 4,400 vehicles on a 6-lane toll plaza in a fraction of a second, at an average vehicle speed of 80 mph, within a 5-mile range. The above capacity is based on the MG OnGate mode. 4) 3 DAYS (TD) and Prepaid Tolls (PP), inter alia, are crucial to this paying platform. To ensure a fail-safe operation, not only digital, electronic and mechanical perfection should be optimized, but also the human fallibility needs to fully considered. 3 DAYS (TD) is an electronic pledge to pay within 3 calendar days at a surcharge of, for example, 50%. The high rate of this surcharge won't likely lure users to have recourse to 3 DAYS. Prepaid Tolls (PP) are not linked to any pre-setup account, like RFID-enabled electronic toll collection systems, such as FasTrak and EZ-Pass. Users may feel free to buy any dollar amount to fill the gap for the balance of PP or pay one or two times or more than that. Local toll authorities may offer some discount for the purchase of Prepaid Tolls in larger unit. 5) Payment processing method: random and point to multipoint, non-serial processing. Non-linear processing will reduce unnecessary time wastage and improve efficiency of payment collection. 6) Creator of ‘JIT e-commerce on the go’ featuring online ordering for JIT pickup or JIT service. JITeCGO is a new eCommerce domain to be implemented on a dashtop mobile payment platform like Drive-On Pay™. The significant rise in demand for bridging the gap between the virtual and real world bring about some new devices and new applications. 7) New potential eCommerce domain for mobile advertising and commercials, different than on the fixed or mobile Internet. At present, cellular technology and GPS tracking techniques are configured to enable mobile advertising and marketing. Big media corporations are thriving on mobile websites, while mobile carriers are cautious to make a sales pitch on GPS-tracking mobile advertising. 8) Security enforcer at public transportation hubs, like airports. Mass surveillance and passenger screening at airports and other transportation hubs are increasingly reliant on the RFID and biometric technology, which is based on serial processing. 9) Optimizer of Remote Check-In featuring ticket-free, biometrics-free admissions. Motorists can buy ball game tickets at the wheel and return them for a refund. Besides, flight passengers can check in for boarding while in the vehicles, thereby saving a long wait in the line for security checks. 10) Booth-free toll-collection maximizer and traffic flow optimizer utilizing Differential Toll Collection System. Drive-On Pay™ can surcharge all the motorists during commute hours and refund the surcharge to commuters only, thereby coaxing non-commuters to voluntarily avoid the commute hours. 11) Potential as the centerpiece of ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) enabling traffic data archiving, traffic data mining, analysis of motorists' behavioral shift, real-time traffic data feeds, target-specific and purpose-specific multicasting of traffic warnings with friendly advice tailored to meet motorist preferences. 12) Pre-formatted messages stored into short keys and buttons both offline and online are transmitted and received between a BS and VIMO units. No need for such input interfaces as keyboard, mouse or stylus, but a finger touch is all you need. As an exception, a pop-up keypad is added for the purpose of authenticating virtual tickets.

A novel photodetector structure utilizes internal reflections from mesa (10, 10') sidewalls and/or from reflective material (22) that is applied to the mesa sidewalls to achieve a concentration of incident infrared radiation into a significantly smaller radiation absorbing region (16).

523,US,US,P,0,Graft copolymers of hydrocarbons and small ring heterocyclic compounds and process for the preparation thereof,"Disclosed are novel graft copolymers comprising hydrocarbon backbones and polymerized small ring heterocyclic compounds. The backbones are devoid of O, N or S in the main chain and include SBR, polybutadiene, butyl rubber, neoprene, EPDM, EPM, PVC, and the like. The hetero atom of the graft branches may be O, S or N as well as combinations thereof and include compounds such as ethers, formals, lactones, sulfides and amines. The invention also relates to a process for cationic grafting of the heterocyclic monomers from the backbone which includes the steps of: substituting a plurality of halogen groups onto the backbone; charging a reaction vessel with the halogenated backbone and the heterocyclic monomer in the presence of a suitable solvent where necessary; mixing the contents thereof to allow at least a portion of the backbone to dissolve in the monomer; adding a suitable salt, which in the presence of an organic halide, such as the halogenated backbone, will polymerize the heterocyclic compound; agitating the contents of the reaction vessel so as to disperse the salt throughout the contents facilitating polymerization; and finally, terminating polymerization and extracting the graft copolymer from the remaining contents via conventional techniques.BACKGROUNDThe present invention relates to graft copolymers containing a halogenated saturated or unsaturated backbone, such as a diene rubber, poly(styrene-co-butadiene) (SBR), butyl rubber, poly(ethylene-co-propylene-co-diene) (EPDM), polyvinylchloride (PVC), polychloroprene (neoprene) and the like, from which are grafted branches of small ring cationically polymerizable heterocyclic compounds such as formals, lactones, amines, sulfides and ethers, particularly tetrahydrofuran (THF). The invention also relates to a process for the cationic preparation of the graft copolymers described herein.Heretofore, it has not been possible to synthesize well-defined graft products free from gel, degradation, or ill-defined materials and having a predicted microstructure, comprising otherwise incompatible polymers such as PVC and polytetrahydrofuran (PTHF) or butyl rubber or ethylene-propylene rubber and PTHF. Given the incompatability of the polymers, a possible synthesis of a product having both would involve the graft polymerization of THF from a polymer backbone of the olefin. Thus, the backbone must carry a site capable of initiating polymerization of THF or other monomer which is to be grafted therefrom.A discussion of known cationic initiators for THF is presented in U.S. Pat. No. 3,824,197, which discloses a method for the preparation of a terminally cationically active or living polymer by the known reaction of THF as well as certain prepolymers with a monobasic acid such as trifluoromethane sulfonic acid or derivatives thereof. This patent and related references are, however, directed toward producing a polycationically active polymer, i.e., a linear straight or branched polymer, having terminally active groups capable of initiating the polymerization of THF or entering into various alkylating and acylating reactions. Notwithstanding the recognition of others in the art that certain monobasic acids can initiate polymerization of THF, there are no references known to us which disclose a method for grafting THF and other heterocyclic monomers from a plurality of halogenated sites, rather than terminal sites on an olefinic polymer backbone, otherwise incompatible with polytetrahydrofuran (PTHF).SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is therefore an object of the present invention to provide novel graft copolymers containing halogenated saturated or unsaturated backbones and graft branches comprising cationically polymerized small ring, heterocyclic compounds, the hetero atoms of which are selected from the group consisting of O, S, N and combinations thereof.It is another object of the present invention to provide a cationic process for the preparation of the novel graft copolymers disclosed herein.These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent from the following description and claims.In general, the graft copolymers of the present invention comprises a backbone derived from a halogenated saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon polymer which is devoid of oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur in the main chain, such as chlorinated butadiene, chlorinated butadiene-styrene, PVC, chlorinated ethylene-propylene rubber, chlorinated EPDM, neoprene, chlorobutyl and the like, and graft branches comprising polymers of small ring heterocyclic compounds wherein the hetero atoms are selected from the group consisting of O, S, N and combinations thereof.The novel graft copolymers described herein are prepared by the steps of substituting a plurality of halogen groups onto the backbone followed by charging a reaction vessel with both the halogenated backbone and the heterocyclic monomer in the presence of a suitable solvent where necessary.

It provides a consumer with advertising?supported stereo audio and video (with stereo audio) entertainment from around the world. The invention includes my sponsor's (purchaser/licensee of the invention) original audio and video programming content (infomercials). These are designed to sell and promote the sponsor's goods and services. The audio and video (with stereo audio) programming is delivered from the Internet via the consumer's home computer. It is wirelessly sent to his/her home stereo system and television set. ","1. The SYOR System Kid's CompuView: This feature enables parents to see and hear (on their SYOR System HDTV) what their children are doing on the Internet. They can “drop in” on a child's computer activity whenever they want to, without the child's knowledge, regardless of the computer's location in the home. The adult simply clicks a button on the TV's remote control without getting up from the couch. According to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, one out of five children who use the Internet has been propositioned by an adult for illicit activities. How can concerned parents monitor their children's Internet activity? Kid's Compuview. This new claim can be marketed by the company which purchases my invention as a valuable tool on the frontline of protecting children who use the Internet.  The SYOR System Couch Sentry: This newly claimed feature enables the user to see and hear (on their SYOR System HDTV) who is at the door before opening it. It works whenever the SYOR System HDTV is turned on, utilizing a wireless outdoor camera. If a knock is heard at the front door, the user simply clicks a button on the TV's remote control. Since the majority of American homes already have the TV turned on after 6:00 pm, this feature is especially useful at night. Statistics show that in most home invasions and robberies, the assailant enters the home through the front door! Opening a door to strangers, particularly at night, is never a good idea. If a mother and children are home alone it's especially unwise. How can families protect themselves? The Couch Sentry. This feature could be particularly valuable to latchkey kids, senior citizens, single moms, etc., to help prevent home invasions and robberies. Additional cameras (available from the company) can monitor the baby's room, driveway, garage, backyard, etc. The Couch Sentry can be marketed as an invaluable home security tool. SYOR System Website Zip Code Page: This is a new page of my invention's website which requires the user to enter his/her zip code in order to continue to the rest of the website. This zip code information is linked to a database of company store locations throughout the U.S. When a SYOR System website audio ad plays, the second page of this ad displays the retail location (by zip code) of the store which is closest and therefore most convenient for the consumer to purchase the product. Company Owned TV and Radio Channels (Webcasts): This new claim proposes the establishment of online radio and television channels to be owned and operated by the company which purchases my invention. By acquiring The SYOR System, the company would already have its own radio and TV networks, so this makes sense. These channels could feature 24 hour rotating infomercials for company goods and services. These channels can also offer informative presentations by The SYOR System Advisor. SYOR System's “Paga Aquf, Toma Alli” (Pay for it here, pick it up there) service: In the Hispanic community, gift giving is very popular, especially at Christmas. Immigrant US workers could virtually send home gifts (toys and electronics) from a U.S. retail chain store by choosing and paying for the gift in one of the store's U.S. locations. Payment can be made by credit card via the SYOR System website or by paying cash. An identical gift may then be picked up by the recipient at an affiliated chain store location in Mexico or Latin America. Advantages of this SYOR System feature include:  Immediate receipt of the gift in Mexico or Latin America. The gift-giver does not have to package the gift, take it to a Post office, pay for freight, insurance, etc. There is no possibility of theft along the way. This service could foster long term relationships between these new US residents, their families in Mexico and Latin America and the retail chain store.  The SYOR SYSTEM Money Transfer Service: The USA's fastest growing ethnic group is Hispanic immigrants. Mexico is the largest contributor to this group; 67% according to the US Census Bureau. Most of these immigrants transfer money (called remittances) home to Mexico and Latin America weekly. In 2005, remittances became Mexico's primary source of income, surpassing the amount of money Mexico makes on oil exports. The SYOR System Money Transfer Service would be most effective if my invention were purchased by a multi-national company such as RadioShack. This company has store locations in Mexico and throughout Latin America. A company like this is ideally positioned to participate in this growing remittance industry. The purchaser could utilize the SYOR System Money Transfer Service in any of these ways:  Utilizing the SYOR System website, credit cards may be used to transfer remittances from the sender in the U.S. to the receiver in Mexico or Latin America. The company could obtain a Western Union Franchise The company could obtain a US bank Individuals could transfer money internationally from store to store.
